## Usage

Once you have cloned the repository to your local machine, you can use the code and resources it contains for various purposes:

### Visual Studio Code (VS Code):

1. Open the cloned project folder in Visual Studio Code.
2. Explore the directory structure to find the source code, assignments, and resources.
3. You can edit the source code files using the built-in text editor or install relevant extensions for Java development.
4. To compile and run Java programs, you can use the integrated terminal or configure tasks and launch configurations.

### Eclipse:

1. Open Eclipse IDE.
2. Import the cloned project into your workspace.
3. Explore the project structure to find the source code, assignments, and resources.
4. You can edit the Java source files directly within Eclipse.
5. Use the built-in features of Eclipse such as syntax highlighting, code completion, and debugging to work with the code.
6. To compile and run Java programs, you can create run configurations and execute them within Eclipse.

Feel free to modify and extend the code according to your learning objectives and requirements. If you encounter any issues or have questions about the code, you can refer to the documentation or reach out for assistance.
